we can connect our python with Database in several methods

1.RAW SQL
2.ORM(Object Relation Models)

## RAW SQL
here we connect with Sql with library to connect with python 
eg: psycopg2 for postgresql
Establish a connection with python and using raw SQL Commands operations are performed.

## ORM(Object Relation Models)
here with the help of normal python programming only we perform all sql queries.
