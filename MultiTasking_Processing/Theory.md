| **Multithreading**  | One cook (CPU) juggling multiple dishes — while one boils, cook preps another.                           |
| **Multiprocessing** | Three cooks (CPUs) each cooking one dish — true parallel cooking.                                        |
| **Asyncio**         | One cook (CPU) who coordinates tasks efficiently by timing everything perfectly (oven → timer → mixing). |
